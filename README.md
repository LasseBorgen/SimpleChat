# SimpleChat

Simple chat allows users to login with Google to enter a single, minimalistic chatroom

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your own local machine, simply follow these instructions

### Prerequisites

This project is based on Google's Firebase. As such, you will first need to have install Node.js and npm on your computer. See: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

After installing Node, you will need to install Google's Firebase-tools. I recommend a global install using the following command-line instruction:

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Deployment

Clone the repository to your local system and cd into the SimpleChat directory.

```
cd SimpleChat
```
Use Firebase's CLI to host a local server

```
firebase server
```
Open your browser and go to localhost, port 5000

```
http://localhost:5000
```
If you don't want to host locally, you can also access the product directly by going to the following url:

```
